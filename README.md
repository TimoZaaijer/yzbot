# yzbot
A discord bot made by yzfire#6822. This is my first real bot, so please be patient with regards to speed of development and things such as that. 
It features:
• userinfo command with optional argument to mention a user.
• help command to give some help and (a bit) of information about yzbot.
• A prefix "."
• ban command to allow you to ban miscreants. (You need to mention a valid user and provide a reason).
• serverinfo command to provide information about the server

I am working on more features that will hopefully be coming to the bot soon.

This project is not open to pull requests and they will be closed immediately. If you would like to suggest a feature, provide some code, or point something out, please contact me on Discord directly (yzfire#6822). I will include a link to a server that I am in soon to enable this.

I am new to GitHub also so I will find out how to do line breaks in due course.
